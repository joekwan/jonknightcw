    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a professional copy and content writer. It’s my job to convey the character and personality of your company to the world. </p>
    <p> One warning, though: to truly endear people, we must risk being sincere. So if you’re looking to hide behind marketing cliché, or to tell your audience everything they want to hear... then I can’t help.</p>
    <p> But, if you have a business that you believe in, I can show people why they should believe in it too.</p>
    <p>*If you want pricing or estimates for a project, or you just have some questions, <a href="#contact">contact me</a>. Don’t be shy; advice is free! </p>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>Your words convey more than just information: they give your clients and colleagues a sense of who you are. You have worked hard to build an image and a reputation. Are your words working just as hard to convey it?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6 left">
    <h3>Copywriting + Editing</h3>
    <p>Don’t lose business with uninspired material. I can give you the copy your company deserves.</p>
    <p>I write promotional materials and creative content, as well as internal documents of all kinds. My work includes client presentations, newsletters, outgoing client communications and more.</p>
    <h3>Web Content + SEO</h3>
    <p>Your website is a window into your company, and its content should leave your clients and colleagues with a favourable impression of who you are.</p>
    <p>The web content I write is Search Engine Optimized, so that your clients and colleagues can find you.</p>
    <p>See some of the websites I’ve worked on <a href="#mywork">below</a>.</p>
    <h3>English Teaching and Training / ESL</h3>
    <p>Are there people at your workplace who struggle with English? Maybe they could use some extra help. Actually, the benefits of language training in the workplace go far beyond increased English skills. <a href="services-esl.html" rel="shadowbox">Take a look</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="grid_6 right">
    <h3>Specialty areas: Industrial</h3>
    <p>I write industrial market copy in a variety of sectors, including aerospace engineering, hydraulics and sealing, and geotechnical engineering, to name a few. </p>
    <p>Industrial writing is about the ability—and business sense—to separate the superfluous from the truly significant. We must be able to explain key concepts and processes in a way that readers can relate to, without sacrificing <a href="samples/sample-industrial.html" rel="shadowbox">important technical details</a>.</p>
    <p>The majority of my work in this area is <a href="#mywork">Website Content</a>.</p>
    <h3>Specialty areas: Financial</h3>
    <p>In finance, it is important to foster trust with warmth, sincerity, and accuracy, and to let our clients <a href="samples/sample-financial.html"rel="shadowbox">feel that they’re taken care of</a>. </p>
    <p>I have extensive experience in this area as a writer, an investor, and as someone who has worked within the financial industry itself.</p>
    <p>My services here include web content, presentations, outgoing communications and client emails, and <a href="#samples">all forms of market copy</a>.</p>

    <p>When we pay extra attention to how we communicate, people feel that we care. Here are some companies that went the extra mile for their readers.</p>
    <h3>Polar Bear Rubber</h3>
    <p>Polar Bear Rubber is an industrial supply company that’s been doing business in Winnipeg for over 35 years.</p>
    <p>In 2011 they gave their website a facelift, and I provided writing.</p>

    <h3>Depth Engineering</h3>
    <p>Depth Engineering is an aerospace engineering consultant company founded in 2011. In the aerospace sector, they do it all: design review, drafting, and assisting on projects right from the outset.</p>
    <p>I write the web copy for their website.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.depthengineering.com" target="_blank">www.depthengineering.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Outgoing Client Communications</h3>
    <p>Richard Malawski’s investment advisory team has been helping people take charge of their finances for over 10 years. They do investment planning, retirement planning and insurance.</p>
    <p>I’ve done a lot of work for them over the last few years, including brochure copy writing, presentations for clientele, and outgoing market updates. Here is an <a href="samples/sample-outgoing-client-communications.pdf" target="_blank">example of the latter</a>.</p>

  <div class="grid_12" id="whyhire">
    <h2>Why hire Jon?</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons you might hire me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are swamped with projects and deadlines.</li>
      <li>You have a writing project that needs to be done right; you need material to inspire and engage readers.</li>
      <li>Writing is not your strength; your time could be better spent elsewhere.</li>
      <li>You want to save time and money by hiring on contract (instead of paying a salaried employee to do it).</li>
      <li>You want to give your company's image a boost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are facing any of these challenges, I can help.</p>
    <h3>What I will provide to you:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Care and enthusiasm for your business.</strong> I want to get to know you and what you stand for. I offer you my total commitment to all projects, large and small.</li>
      <li><strong>Experience and technical know-how.</strong> Knowledge of craft and careful attention to detail &mdash; along with hard work &mdash; means that I am not satisfied until your project is done right.</li>
      <li><strong>Honesty.</strong> I will always be up front about project feasibility, costs, turnaround times, and, well, everything else. If there is a problem I will tell you, and if I think we can improve on something I will tell you that too.</li>
      <li><strong>Good turnaround time.</strong> I am known for quick turnaround times, and if you contact me for any reason, you will always hear back from me that same day or the following morning. I will always let you know exactly what to expect in terms of timeframes before going forward.</li>
      <li><strong>Save money.</strong> Hiring me on contract means you only pay for the services you use. No need for expensive salaries or benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I put pride and care into my writing because it stands for you and your business. I want to give you material you can be proud of &mdash; words readers notice.</p>
    <h3>Rates and What to Expect</h3>
    <p>It is my job to convey your company’s image and competitive advantages through words, be it marketing materials, web content, or otherwise.</p>
    <p>The first thing we need to do is discuss the project’s scope and details, and then I can provide you with a rough quote.</p>
    <p>From here it is best to meet in person, so that I can get to know you and your business (though this isn’t always feasible).</p>
    <p>Once we’ve decided on the details, I will provide a contract, and then we can get started.</p>
    <div class="grid_6 alpha left">
      <h4>Rates</h4>
      <p>All rates are based on a $60 hourly fee. That means cost-per-word will vary based on project length and difficulty.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My rate for web content in the financial and industrial sectors is 25 cents / word.</li>
        <li>Rates for other marketing materials are 15 cents / word.</li>
        <li>Rates for editing and proofreading are  5 cents / word.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>*These rates vary depending on the nature and scope of the project. Please note that is my responsibility to provide you with accurate rates up front, and I will always do so before we get started.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid_6 omega right">
      <h4>Revisions</h4>
      <p>I offer up to two free revisions. After that the hourly fee of $60/hour applies.</p>
      <p>*Please note that I will always check with you before proceeding with anything that will incur additional fees!</p>
