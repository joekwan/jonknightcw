  <h1>Financial writing</h1>
  <p>In finance, it is important for your clients to feel that they are being looked after by <em>real people</em> who genuinely care, and who have the know-how to guide them to success.</p>
  <p>To reinforce this impression with your writing, make sure that the subjects of your sentences are human beings &mdash; instead of abstract concepts &mdash; who are actively doing real, tangible things. Avoid loose, overlong sentences and don’t shy from the human element in your writing. Take responsibility with the active voice and be accurate and direct with your language; try to avoid nominalised verbs and frill.</p>
  <p>Below is an excerpt from “Bennett Financial”; we can improve it significantly.</p>
