  <h1>Workplace English Teaching and Training / ESL</h1>
  <p>Most people want to be good at what they do. They want to excel, and they want to take on new and interesting challenges at work.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Canadian immigrants are often held back by poor English skills</strong>.</p>
  <p>The good news is that training them in English has tremendous benefits for both <strong>employers</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>employees</strong>.</p>
  <h4>The Benefits of on-site English Training:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidence begets Confidence</strong>. A company’s faith in its employees is rewarded with better morale and increased teamwork, as well as reduced turnover. Better communication also means fewer interpersonal problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Save Money.</strong> Better communication and understanding leads to reduced error rates and less waste. This also means a safer work environment. People trained in English are also more likely to read internal documents, such as manuals, newsletters, and safety documentation. </li>
    <li><strong>Identify and Empower those with Potential</strong>. English training is a great way to develop (and identify!) those with the character and skillset to go further within your company. People with real leadership potential may not have the communication skills to unlock it. Essentially this equates to an <strong>expanded hiring pool</strong> of people within the company – people who are already trained in its processes and culture. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Palliser Furniture is one company that has had a lot of success with in-house ESL/English teaching programs. You can read about their program <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
  <p>*Note that I am in no way affiliated with Palliser Furniture, nor with its English program.</p>
  <p>I am a certified English (EAL) instructor; I teach English to new immigrants and others looking to improve their language skills. If you have employees who need support with English, or you are looking for some extra guidance yourself, I can help. Contact me for details and availability. Setting up a program involves determining:</p>
  <h4>Objectives</h4>
  <p>Typical objectives include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Communication and teamwork</li>
    <li>Literacy, numeracy</li>
    <li>Computer skills</li>
    <li>Work related vocabulary and safety</li>
    <li>Identification of employees looking to take on new challenges</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Rates</h4>
  <p>Rates are <strong>$40 per hour of instruction</strong>. This does not increase per number of students, and <strong>preparation time is included in this cost</strong>.</p>
  <p>Typically, teaching would occur at the place of business. This can be during business hours, or otherwise.</p>
  <p><a href="#contact">Contact me</a> for suggestions on program arrangements. I can give you some ideas, and examples of how other successful companies handle English training.</p>
  <p>*I also have a great deal of experience preparing people to take the <strong>IELTS / TOEFL</strong> standardized tests (good scores on these tests are a requirement for both immigration and University admissions). If this is important to you or to someone you know, please don’t hesitate to <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
