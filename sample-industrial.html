<h1>Industrial writing</h1>
<p>The key to successful industrial copy is the ability to explain complex concepts and processes clearly and directly. The writing should be concise, consistent, and devoid of frill, though some warmth and personality can go a long way to inspiring confidence in potential clients. Finally, technical detail and accuracy is extremely important, especially when tech-savvy colleagues rely on your material to obtain specific information about your products or methods.</p>
  <p>This first example from Jensen Fittings isn’t bad, but we can make it better. Mouse-over the original to see details on what can be improved.<br />
